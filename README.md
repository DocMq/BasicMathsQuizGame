User Feedback: Provide immediate feedback on whether the user's answer was correct or incorrect.
Customizable: Easily modify questions, options, and answers to suit different quiz themes or difficulty levels.
Code Readability: Organized code into functions for better readability and maintainability.

Features:
Questions and Options: The quiz consists of 10 basic math questions, each with four multiple-choice options.
Scoring System: The user's score is tracked and displayed at the end of the quiz.
User Input: Users can input their answers, and the input is validated to ensure correctness.
Feedback: Immediate feedback is provided for each question, showing the correct answer if the user is wrong.
Final Score Display: The user's final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.
Customizable: The quiz questions, options, and correct answers can be easily modified.
